### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to empower users to explore British Airways reviews across various countries from March 2016 to October 2023. The primary objective was to develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to analyze different service metrics, seat types, traveler categories, and aircraft models. By enabling users to adjust parameters and timelines, the dashboard facilitates the discovery of patterns and trends, providing a flexible tool for data-driven decision-making and enhancing the understanding of the airlineâ€™s performance by country. The focus is on creating a user-friendly platform where users can generate their own insights based on their specific interests and needs.

### Data Sources
The primary datasets used for this analysis are the [ba_reviews.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16742580/ba_reviews.csv) and [Countries.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16742583/Countries.csv) files. The first dataset includes comprehensive details on each review, such as overall rating, cabin staff service, entertainment, food & beverages, ground service, seat comfort, as well as seat type, traveler type, aircraft type, and other relevant information. The second file contains country name, code, region, and continent.

### Tools
 - **Tableau Desktop:** Used for data analysis, report creation, and visualizations.
 - **Tableau Public:** Used for sharing the dashboard online.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The purpose of this dashboard is to allow users to explore British Airways review data between March 2016 and October 2023, enabling them to answer questions like:

 - Which countries have the highest and lowest average ratings for British Airways?
 - How do service metrics like cabin staff service and ground service vary by country and over time?
 - What are the trends in seat comfort ratings across different seat types and traveler types?
 - How do the experiences of different traveler types compare in terms of overall satisfaction and specific service metrics?
 - Does the type of aircraft have a significant impact on traveler ratings and satisfaction?
 - How have British Airways' service ratings changed over time?

These questions are intended to guide users in their exploration, helping them make the most of the dashboard's interactive features. The analyst's goal was to create a dynamic tool that allows users to play with different metrics, parameters, and timelines, rather than delivering a static report with predefined insights. This approach is particularly useful when the data is complex, and users have varying needs or interests.

### Visualization
This dashboard provides an interactive platform for users to explore the data, select relevant parameters, and gain insights into British Airways' performance across various countries and metrics. You can access the dashboard via the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ana.m7389/viz/BritishAirways_reviewsbycountry_map/BAMapDashboard

The dashboard features three key visuals:

1) **Static Total Average Ratings:** Displays the overall average ratings for each service metric.
2) **Average Metrics by Country:** Allows users to compare average ratings by country against the total average ratings. This visual updates dynamically based on selected metrics, parameters, and timeline.
3) **Average Ratings by Month:** Shows trends in ratings over time, with data changing according to the selected metrics, parameters, and timeline.

Additionally, when hovering over the map, you'll see the average rating and the number of reviews for each country. This interactive feature enhances the user's ability to analyze performance data in detail, providing a comprehensive view of British Airways' service quality across different regions and time periods.
